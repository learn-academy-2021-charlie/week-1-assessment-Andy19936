# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: a function is a bit of programming that is completely independent from the rest of your code that you are assigning to a variable so you can continue to reuse that same bit of code over and over again with different inputs everytime if needed. 

  Researched answer: According to our syllabus a function is a set of contained instructions used to execute an action over and over again.



2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: a parameter is similar to a place holder within the function and an argument is the actual input being put into the function.

  Researched answer: parameters are named variables in functions used to bring in the actual values which are called arguments.  



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: an index is a location within a data type and a value is the actual result from the position in the data type. 

  Researched answer: after some research... value is a definite object like "a" number 3 "true" and index is the address in which those values are stored "index"
                     01234  <-index address for letters within index



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: a built in method is an action that has been used over enough times to be considered valuable to store to a command within a coding language. 

  Researched answer:built in methods are common actions that javascript has stored premade functions for datatype string



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming techniques to me are going over the task at hand so were all on the samepage come up with ideas  begin coding and establish good switching points. while the driver types out their code the person watching is looking for typos giving suggestions when needed and the person driving is sharing their screen while coding making sure to communicate what they are doing

  Researched answer: Getiing into pairs and coming up with a plan setting up all your tech needed for the the task at hand and getting started the driver is sharing their screen listening for instructions from the navigator, the navigator going over the tsk with the driver checking for errors and giving a helping hand when needed both are responcible for constant communication!



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: What I found helpful this week is something we do everyday which is pair programming I did not think I was going to like it at first but it is so much better for one knowing that someone might be struggling on the same concept you are and researching the topic together to find a solution and for two having someone who has a greater understanding of thing you might be struggling with and can not only help you by showing you what to do but also explain to you from a beginners point of view.
